# SteamFriendsEnhanced

This Google Chrome Extension will allow for a UI addition to Non Friend Steam Users to still allow them to have Nicknames added.
Steam will often purge Nickname Data for non Friends and so this information will be locally backed up. When the account is re-visited the tool will automatically re-apply the nickname if it is not present.\
Additionally, there will be an attempt at an additional drop down similar to an accounts previous aliases but to list alt accounts with their steam url link.
